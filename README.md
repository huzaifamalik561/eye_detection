# Eye Distance Calculator App

This is a Streamlit web application that calculates the distance between eyes in two uploaded images. The app uses OpenCV for face and eye detection to determine the eye distance. It also provides a scatter plot for visualizing the calculated distances.

## Getting Started

To run this application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/eye-distance-calculator.git
   cd eye-distance-calculator](https://github.com/huzaifamalik561/eye_detection.git)
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py

#Requirements
Python 3.6+
OpenCV (opencv-python)
Streamlit (streamlit)
NumPy (numpy)
Matplotlib (matplotlib)
Pillow (Pillow)

#pip install -r requirements.txt

#Usage
Upload two high-resolution images using the file upload widgets.
The app will display the uploaded images along with the calculated eye distances.
Make sure to upload high-resolution images for accurate results.
The scatter plot provides a visual representation of the eye distances in both images.

#Note
This app is provided as-is and for educational purposes. The accuracy of the eye distance calculation depends on the quality of the images and the effectiveness of the face and eye detection models.
